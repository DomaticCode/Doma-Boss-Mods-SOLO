Doma's Boss Mods for Captain's Assistant in Sword of Legends Online

## What does it do?
The captain's assistant tracks boss skills and events. It allows you to create Popups with sound, text, and other little things to immediately notify you if the boss is casting an ability, at a certain hp, or a few other situations.
For instance it can tell you 
- [to stack on party members](https://i.imgur.com/Zf8Aojv.gif) to soak abilities which require soaking
- when you need to [dodge an ability](https://i.imgur.com/MqWRB07.gif)
- and drastically increase your speed to [reacting to dangerous abilities](https://i.imgur.com/TrVJbWd.gif)

If you are party leader it will also extend these notifications to the people who need it (everyone for large abilities) or even only the specific people targeted by the ability.

## About my Boss Mods
I have seen some captain's assistants taken from the Chinese forums but they seem to be hit and miss, some bosses have way too many notifications and some have way too little.
That is why I developed my own settings tracking all mechanics of bosses which I find are important. 
All of which follow a pattern both by sound, text, and emojis to hopefully be easy to know at a glance exactly what you need to do.

If you just want the notifications the only player that needs to have this installed is the Group leader, everyone else will receive the pings but they will not see the trackers which give you an idea of when an ability might be casted again.
Also, if the group leader is not running any boss event monitoring these will still work locally for you (so watch as people die in mechanics you get notifications for).

## How to install:
Firstly in Game find the Captain's Assistant Icon in the game bar next to combat stats ![captains assistant](https://i.imgur.com/LrWxaMC.png)

Find the folder you downloaded, and unzip it using 7-zip winRAR or Windows Extract ALL...![unzip](https://i.imgur.com/0x3a5c7.png)

Inside the folder find which dungeon/files you want to install (go into the folders themselves and find the .cen files) ![.cen files](https://i.imgur.com/OJrIGeP.png)

Now go back into the game and *right click* the Captain's Assistant icon (the same icon you left clicked earlier) To bring up the Boss Event Monitoring window ![captains assistant](https://i.imgur.com/LrWxaMC.png)

Now right click anywhere in the black box on the left side of this window and SHIFT click the import event from file popup ![boss event monitoring](https://i.imgur.com/SmXsnWY.png)

This will open up the directory for you to import the .cen files (the directory for this is Swords of Legends Online\Interface\Addons\CombatEventMonitor) ![folder](https://i.imgur.com/5AFYKpH.png)

Drag and drop or copy and paste the .cen files from the folder you unzipped and would like to install into this directory ![importing](https://i.imgur.com/Jg8u9zY.png)

Lastly return to the game, right click in the black box in the Boss Event Monitoring window and just normal left click import event from file

This will bring up the list of all files you put into the directory and allow you to import them one by one. ![importing in game](https://i.imgur.com/Iom5AZZ.png)

You should then see the imported dungeons/raids in your Boss Event Monitoring window ![done importing](https://i.imgur.com/x8ICSpK.png)

And you can click through all the bosses and see the exact skills I track, when they trigger, and what they say ![all done](https://i.imgur.com/U7nHw20.png)

After installing I would reccomend deleting the files you imported so your next import will be cleaner to import in game **BUT DO NOT DELETE THE Cen.Folder THIS IS ALL YOUR IN GAME BOSS EVENT MONITORING FILES.**
