Doma's Boss Mods for Captain's Assistant in Sword of Legends Online

## What does it do?
The captain's assistant tracks boss skills and events. It allows you to create Popups with sound, text, and other little things to immediately notify you if the boss is casting an ability, at a certain hp, or a few other situations.
For instance it can tell you 
- [to stack on party members](https://i.imgur.com/Zf8Aojv.gif) to soak abilities which require soaking
- when you need to [dodge an ability](https://i.imgur.com/MqWRB07.gif)
- and drastically increase your speed to [reacting to dangerous abilities](https://i.imgur.com/TrVJbWd.gif)

If you are party leader it will also extend these notifications to the people who need it (everyone for large abilities) or even only the specific people targeted by the ability.

## About my Boss Mods
I have seen some captain's assistants taken from the Chinese forums but they seem to be hit and miss, some bosses have way too many notifications and some have way too little.
That is why I developed my own settings tracking all mechanics of bosses which I find are important. 
All of which follow a pattern both by sound, text, and emojis to hopefully be easy to know at a glance exactly what you need to do.
