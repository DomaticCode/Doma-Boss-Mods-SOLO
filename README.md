Doma's Boss Mods for Captain's Assistant in Sword of Legends Online

## What does it do?
The captain's assistant tracks boss skills and events. It allows you to create Popups with sound, text, and other little things to immediately notify you if the boss is casting an ability, at a certain hp, or a few other situations.
For instance it can tell you 
- to stack on party members to soak abilities which require soaking
